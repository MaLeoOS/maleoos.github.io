<h1>pretty Halcyon Days</h1>

<h4>How pleasant to sit on the beach,</h4>
<p>
  On the beach
  , on the sand, in the sun, <br>
  With <b class="ocean">ocean</b> galore within reach, <br>
  And nothing at all to be done!
  <br>No letters to answer,
  <br>No bill be burs toned,
  <br>No work to be shirked,
  <br>No cash to be earned.
  <br>
  It is pleasant to sit on the beach<br>
  With nothing at all to be done.
</p>

<h4>How pleasant to look at the<b class="ocean"> ocean</b>,</h4>
<p>
  Democratic and damp; indiscriminate; <br>
  It fills me with noble emotion <br>
  To think I am able to swim in it. <br>
  To lave in the wave, <br>
  Majestic and chilly, <br>
  Tomorrow I crave; <br>
  But today it is silly. <br>
  It is pleasant to look at the <b class="ocean">ocean</b>;<br>
  Tomorrow, perhaps, I shall swim in it. 
</p>

<h4>How pleasant to gaze at the sailors,</h4>

<p>
   <span>
       
  As their sailboats they manfully sail <br>
  With the vigor of vikings and whalers <br>
  In the days of the viking and whale. <br>
  They sport on the brink <br>
  Of the shad and the shark; <br>
  If it's windy they sink; <br>
  If it isn't, they park. <br>
  It is pleasant to gaze at the sailors, <br>
  To gaze without having to sail.</span>

</span>
</p>



<h4>How pleasant the salt anaesthetic</h4>
<p>
  Of the air and the sand and the sun; <br>
  Leave the earth to the strong and athletic, <br>
  And the sea to adventure upon. <br>
  But the sun and the sand <br>
  No contractor can copy; <br>
  We lie in the land <br>
  Of the lotus and poppy; <br>
  We vegetate, calm and aesthetic, <br>
  On the beach, on the sand, in the sun. 
</p>
